NLP involves the use of various computational techniques to enable machines to process, analyze, and understand natural language data such as text, speech, and other forms of communication. NLP can be used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and chatbots. Some of the key techniques used in NLP include text preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical analysis. Overall, NLP aims to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding, enabling machines to interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way.")
